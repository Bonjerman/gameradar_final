      Halo Infinite is the sequel to Halo 5: Guardians and the third part of the Reclaimer Saga. It was developed by 343 Industries. It is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs. The multiplayer was released on November 15, 2021 for the 20th Anniversary of Halo and the Campaign was released on December 8, 2021.

Halo Infinite will likely feature the cooperative play system of Halo 5: Guardians, with features such as splitscreen co-op and Forge being added post-launch sometime in 2022. The multiplayer segment is compeltely free and can be downloaded seperately from the main campaign, but the campaign must be paid for.

      Forza Horizon 5 is a 2021 racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Xbox Game Studios. The twelfth main instalment of the Forza series, the game is set in a fictionalised representation of Mexico. It was released on 9 November 2021 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

The game received critical acclaim and became a commercial success upon release; it launched to over ten million players in the first week, the biggest-ever launch for an Xbox Game Studios game. The game was nominated for three jury-voted awards at The Game Awards 2021, winning all three of its nominations and tying with Hazelight's It Takes Two for most wins, and was also nominated for the public-voted Players' Voice award, which went to fellow Xbox Game Studios title Halo Infinite.[4]
